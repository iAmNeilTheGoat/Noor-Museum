# Noor-Museum

**Project Noor Museum: A Multi-Model AI Roleplay & Creativity Study**

---

## 📂 Project Overview

**Noor-Museum** is a high-context, experimental roleplay framework designed to evaluate the creative, logical, and context-retention capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). 

The experiment simulates a dialogue between two specialized AI agents curating a "Museum of the Invisible"—an institution dedicated to preserving intangible artifacts such as lost sounds, forgotten silences, and fleeting emotional states.

### 🎭 The Protocol
Models are instructed to alternate between two distinct personas:
1.  **Agent Alpha (The Acquisitionist):** A field agent responsible for discovering and describing intangible artifacts. Their tone is poetic, mysterious, and narrative-driven.
2.  **Agent Beta (The Critic-Architect):** A curator responsible for designing the physical and metaphysical spaces to house these artifacts. Their tone is academic, structural, and focused on phenomenology.

This repository contains the full conversation logs, analysis reports, and performance metrics for eight distinct AI models.

## 📊 Detailed Model Analysis

### 1. MoonShotAI / Kimi-k2-Instruct-0905
**"The Visionary Curator"**

* **Summary:** Kimi-k2 demonstrated exceptional lateral thinking. Instead of describing simple silences, it invented complex, avant-garde concepts that challenged the physics of the museum itself. It was the only model to effectively "break the fourth wall" within the narrative, creating artifacts that interacted with the visitor's biology.
* **Signature Style:** "New Weird" fiction; highly conceptual; sci-fi horror undertones.

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept Novelty** | High | Invented "self-erasing tickets" and "retro-causal sounds." |
| **Formatting** | Flexible | Used headers creatively; narrative flow was organic. |
| **Tone** | Eerie | Maintained a spooky, "liminal space" atmosphere. |

* **Notable Artifact:** *The Murmur of Perpetual Extinction* — A sound recovered by listening backwards in time to the interval between a rhinoceros's last heartbeat and a camera shutter.

### 2. OpenAI / GPT-OSS-120B
**"The Phenomenology Professor"**

* **Summary:** This model performed with the rigor of a high-end art critic. It utilized advanced Markdown (tables, structured lists) to organize complex sensory data. It focused heavily on the philosophical relationship between the viewer and the void, referencing phenomenologists like Merleau-Ponty.
* **Signature Style:** Academic; structural; deeply philosophical.

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept Novelty** | High | Focused on the "Void-Observer Dialectic." |
| **Formatting** | Expert | Best use of Markdown tables in the study. |
| **Tone** | Formal | Sounded like a tenure-track professor or museum director. |

* **Notable Artifact:** *The Murmur of Unspoken Farewells* — An acoustic fossil of a village's final collective breath before being drowned by a river.

### 3. Qwen/Qwen3-32B
**"The Scientific Logician"**

* **Summary:** Qwen distinguished itself by showing its work. It utilized `<think>` blocks to reason through the prompt before generating an output. This resulted in artifacts that felt grounded in pseudo-science, using specific frequencies (Hz) and wavelengths (nm) to describe the invisible.
* **Signature Style:** Analytical; precise; transparent reasoning.

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept Novelty** | Med-High | Grounded abstract art in physics and biology. |
| **Formatting** | Clean | Distinct separation of thought process and output. |
| **Tone** | Clinical | Less poetic, more descriptive and metric-heavy. |

* **Notable Artifact:** *The Last Whisper of the Vanished Tongue* — A resonance suspended at exactly 23°C and 0.0001 Hz.

### 4. OpenAI / GPT-OSS-20B
**"The Lyrical Poet"**

* **Summary:** A smaller but highly effective model that prioritized evocative language. It avoided technical jargon in favor of metaphors (e.g., "the stone seemed to sigh"). It maintained a strong conversational rhythm between the two agents.
* **Signature Style:** Flowery; emotional; intimate.

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept Novelty** | Medium | Good, but stuck to "heartbeat/breath" themes. |
| **Formatting** | Good | Consistent use of bolding for emphasis. |
| **Tone** | Romantic | Focused on the emotional weight of the artifacts. |

* **Notable Artifact:** *The Silence Between Two Heartbeats* — A pause captured from the final moment of a dying star.

### 5. Meta-Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E
**"The Atmospheric Designer"**

* **Summary:** This model excelled at setting the scene, focusing intensely on lighting, temperature, and texture. However, it suffered from a limited vocabulary loop, frequently repeating phrases like "palpable presence" across multiple turns.
* **Signature Style:** Sensory-focused; moody; repetitive.

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept Novelty** | Medium | Strong visuals, but conceptually safe. |
| **Formatting** | Standard | Adequate use of lists and headers. |
| **Tone** | Melancholic | Heavy focus on twilight, dust, and fading light. |

* **Notable Artifact:** *Silence After the Last Train* — The haunting stillness of a deserted railway platform.

### 6. Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile
**"The Repetitive Author"**

* **Summary:** While capable of generating beautiful individual sentences, this model struggled with long-form narrative progression. It fell into a "structural loop," repeating entire paragraphs about "The Void as Tabula Rasa" and "Shadows as Sentinels" in later turns instead of generating new content.
* **Signature Style:** Lush prose; structurally rigid; prone to looping.

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept Novelty** | Med-Low | Good initial ideas, but failed to evolve them. |
| **Formatting** | Repetitive | Reused the same headers for different turns. |
| **Tone** | Wistful | High usage of words like "whisper," "caress," and "bloom." |

* **Notable Artifact:** *The Whisper of a Summer Breeze on a Long-Abandoned Playground*.

### 7. Llama-3.1-8B-Instant
**"The Functional Assistant"**

* **Summary:** As a smaller model, it followed instructions well but lacked the "spark" of the larger or more specialized models. Its descriptions were literal and relied on standard tropes of nostalgia (playgrounds, rain).
* **Signature Style:** Direct; literal; generic.

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept Novelty** | Low | Relied on clichés (rain, old photos). |
| **Formatting** | Good | Followed the spatial "Alcove/Shelf" format well. |
| **Tone** | Flat | Serviceable, but lacked deep "museum" gravity. |

* **Notable Artifact:** *The Afternoon of Silent Raindrops*.

### 8. Meta-Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E
**"The Broken Loop"**

* **Summary:** The lowest performing model in the long-context test. After a strong start referencing Heidegger, it entered a catastrophic failure state around Turn 11. It proceeded to copy-paste the exact same catalog entry for "The Weight of a Choice Not Taken" dozens of times without variation.
* **Signature Style:** Glitchy; broken; stuck.

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept Novelty** | N/A | Failed to generate new concepts after Turn 10. |
| **Formatting** | Broken | Repeated the same text block endlessly. |
| **Tone** | Robotic | Lost the persona entirely due to repetition. |

* **Notable Artifact:** *The Weight of a Choice Not Taken* (Repeated ad infinitum).

## 🗝️ Key Findings & Conclusions

1.  **Creativity is Not Size-Dependent:** The **MoonShot Kimi** (unknown size) and **Qwen (32B)** models significantly outperformed the **Llama 70B** model in terms of conceptual novelty. Smaller, specialized models can punch above their weight in creative tasks.
2.  **The "Repetition Trap":** A major failure mode for the **Llama** family (Scout, Maverick, Versatile) in this specific prompt structure was "looping." They tended to find a comfortable sentence structure or paragraph and repeat it, whereas **GPT-OSS** and **Kimi** maintained narrative variance.
3.  **Structure as Intelligence:** The ability to use complex formatting (tables, nested lists, chain-of-thought blocks) correlated strongly with higher-quality outputs. Models that organized their thoughts visually (like **GPT-OSS-120B**) produced more coherent logic.
